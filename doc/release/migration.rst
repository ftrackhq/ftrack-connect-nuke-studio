Moving from 1.X to 2.X
======================

This new release is a complete rewrite of the plugin, and introduces different workflow and breaking changes.
Is therefore suggested, as minimum, to `cleanup the project from any custom ftrack tag <https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/content/timeline_environment/usingtags/removing_tags.html>`_, 
and remove any previously saved task and processor presets users might have been saving.
Is prefereable though to create a new project from scratch so no old settings and hidden tags are retained.
